      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software developer from St. Louis, who lives in the Midwest.
        Growing up, I was always fascinated with machines and technology. These
        interests have taking me down a wide variety industries, helping me
        build a strong foundation of technological skills from low/high voltage
        electronics, pneumatics, hydraulics, and finally computer programming.
        The aggregate result of this experience helps give me a unique approach
        to problem solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my technology career at a small business. Typical of many
        small businesses, I wore many hats. I worked as the network
        administrator, desktop support, in-house developer, web site
        administrator, systems administrator, and domain administrator.
        Additionally, I had to maintain the VOIP system as well as the
        low-voltage access control system. These days I work more as a
        full-stack cloud developer, but my need to learn everything about a
        given environment certainly has roots in my beginnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a full-stack developer I get the enjoyment of in-the-trenches coding,
        and the high-level architect point of view. I find it particularly
        enjoyable setting up CI/CD workflows, and seeing developers faces light
        up when a simple push to the master branch triggers a full-scale
        deployment. I was fortunate to be given access to AWS in its formative
        days, and got to witness the growth of the various cloud providers and
        their offerings first hand.
